# **Foundations of Machine Learning**

## **README**

### **Assignment Overview**

This repository contains solutions to three machine learning assignments, each focusing on a different aspect of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and classification. All algorithms are implemented from scratch without the use of standard machine learning libraries. Below are the details for each assignment:

### **Assignment 1: Supervised Learning**

#### **Objective**  
To implement and analyze supervised learning algorithms using a given dataset.

#### **Tasks**  
1. **Gradient Descent Algorithm**  
   - Implement the gradient descent algorithm.  
   - Find the least square solution for the dataset.  

2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm (SGD)**  
   - Implement and analyze the stochastic gradient descent algorithm.  

3. **Ridge Regression with Cross-Validation**  
   - Implement Ridge Regression.  
   - Perform cross-validation to determine the optimal regularization parameter.  

4. **Kernel Regression**  
   - Implement kernel regression from scratch.  
   - Compare the results of all methods to determine the most effective algorithm for the dataset.

### **Assignment 2: Spam or Ham Classifier**

#### **Objective**  
To build a binary email classifier capable of distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.

#### **Tasks**  
1. **Build the Classifier**  
   - Implement a spam classifier from scratch using publicly available datasets.  

2. **Functionality**  
   - The classifier should accept a folder of email text files as input.  
   - For each email, it should output:  
     - `1` for **spam**  
     - `0` for **not spam**

### **Assignment 3: Unsupervised Learning**

#### **Objective**  
To explore dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques using real-world datasets.

#### **Tasks**  
1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
   - Perform PCA on the MNIST dataset.  
   - Reconstruct the dataset using different numbers of principal components.  
   - Analyze the quality of reconstruction for varying components.  

2. **K-Means Clustering**  
   - Implement Lloydâ€™s algorithm for K-means clustering.  
   - Perform clustering with \( K = 2, 3, 4, 5 \).  
   - Plot clusters and their corresponding Voronoi regions for each \( K \).

### **General Instructions**

1. **Implementation**  
   - All algorithms must be implemented from scratch without the use of libraries designed for these purposes.  
   - Use modular programming to ensure code readability and reusability.  

2. **Report**  
   - Submit a detailed report analyzing the results for each task.  
   - Include visualizations where applicable to support your findings.  

3. **Submission**  
   - Ensure the code is well-documented and tested.  
   - Include the following in your submission:  
     - Source code  
     - Report (in PDF format)  
     - Example inputs and outputs
